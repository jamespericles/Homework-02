            Full Stack Web Developer leveraging a psychology background and its
            concepts to create an engaging user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            After practicing psychology and bartending, I realized I wanted a
            new challenge. I earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from
            the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill where I advanced my
            skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript. In addition to these skills I also
            taught myself Swift and Python to help round out my skill sets.
          </p>
          <p>
            From earning a management position in highschool, to working two
            jobs to support myself through college, and now pivoting into the
            tech industry, I am constantly looking for a new way to challenge
            and improve myself. I have great time management skills, a tireless
            work ethic, and I crave a challenging workplace and an environment
            that fosters growth. It is these skills that have helped me become a
            software developer, and helped me master the skills taught in my
            certificate program. It is often my strong sense of leadership,
            can-do attitude and unyielding work ethic that leads me to
            leadership positions. I thrive on leading those around me to
            accomplishing our goals. Check out some of

            Below are some of the projects I'm most proud of. A link to each
            repo is provided.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Employee Management System
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://github.com/jamespericles/Employee-Management-System"

              <span class="label">GitHub</span>

          <span class="image main"
            ><img
              src="images/start_screen.png"
              alt="Employee Management Start Screen"
          /></span>
          <p>
            The Employee Management System is a CLI project that utilizes
            Node.js, Javascript, and MySQL to create a robust application to
            manage a population of employees. It offers several different
            functions, including the ability to not only create employees,
            roles, and departments, but also manipulate them after their
            creation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am very proud of this project, particularly the way I made it so
            that existing data can be retrieved and presented as choices where
            appropriate. This required me to nest several queries within one
            another. This project also taught me how to rebase a repository!
          </p>
          <h3>
            Random Password Generator
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://github.com/jamespericles/Random-Password-Generator"
              class="icon brands fa-github"
            >
              <span class="label">GitHub</span>

              src="images/Password_Generator.png"
              alt="Password Generator Site"
          /></span>
          <p>
            Choosing from four different groups of characters, users are able to
            create a password ranging from 8-128 characters in length. Besides
            displaying the generated password, the user may also copy them
            directly to their clipboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project comes in two flavors! I was expected to build it using
            Javascript and basic HTML early on in my Bootcamp. Over a long
            weekend, I taught myself XCode and Swift by recreating this project
            over the course of three days. The repository for the Swift version
            of this project can be found

            Read Me Generator

              href="https://github.com/jamespericles/README-Generator"

          <p>
            This CLI application utilizes Node.js and Inquirer to prompt the
            user with several questions related to their README file.
            Afterwards, the answers given are used to affect the document in
            several ways. Through the user of ternary operators, the user is
            able to delete unnecessary sections of the README. The document
            generates in a Github friendly way, including links to each section
            of the document.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have ended up using this project for each assignment I've been
            assigned after its creation.

          <p>
            Born in Bel Air, Maryland, I moved to Lillington North Carolina to
            attend college at Campbell University after being awarded the
            presidential scholarship. Besides graduating with my Bachelor's in
            Psychology, I also earned a minor in Chemistry and another in
            General Science while also being inducted into the Rho Kapa Honor's
            Society. When I wasn't studying, I was either at the gym or hiking
            with my German Shepherd, Odin.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduation, I intended to take a gap year before pursuing a
            Master's degree. In that time, I worked as both a Behavioral
            Technician and waiter, before dedicating myself to bartending full
            time. It was towards the beginning of 2020 I decided I wanted a new
            challenge, and began my journey to Full Stack Web Developer though
            UNC Chapel Hill.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've learned a lot in the last few years, and am excited to see what
            my career as a Full-Stack Developer has in store for me. To get a
            better idea of my skill set, please
